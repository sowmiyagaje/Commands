4. If you want to become better devops engineer its not about only writing script from scratch, you should know how to fix the issues in exsisting scripts. In [palindrome.sh](https://github.com/DeekshithSN/Lets-Practice/blob/main/ShellScript/Script/palindrome.sh) we are expecting one param i.e, string that you need check whether its palindrome or not. one issue is if user doesn't supply string, its executing to the success ( exit status of script is zero ) and o/p is "this is not palindrome", but its not correct. we should handle it properly. if the string is not supplied to the script,it shuold execute to failure ( exit status should not be zero ) and error message which says "Please supply string for which you want to check palindrome" 

```
📏 : Easy 
🔑 : make use of if condition and positional parameters concept 
``` 
------------------------
5. Identify the position of the parameter, lets say we have script position.sh that can accept n number of parameters, assume "-f" is one of the param. whenever the script is executed we need identify the position of "-f"?

```
  Examples - 
  1. sh position.sh a b -f d
     Output: position is 3
  2. sh position.sh a b z x -f 
     Output: position is 5
  3. sh position.sh
     Output: -f is not supplied
```
```

6. Need a script which get us information like public ip, used memory capacity,time, loggedin username. here we need to give user options, for what what info needed?like if user executes ( assuming script file name is info.sh )
 - info.sh ip  : print public ip
 - info.sh memory : print used memory capacity 
 - info.sh time : print time with timestamp 
 - info.sh user : print loggedin user name 

```
📏 : Easy 
🔑 : make use of case and other basic commands like date, df and logname. to get public ip use https://api.ipify.org   
```

7. The script [error.sh](https://github.com/DeekshithSN/Lets-Practice/blob/main/ShellScript/Script/error.sh) has few syntax issues please correct it and even there are logical issues correct the same. The purpose of the script is to idenfity & store the file names which has more that 10 lines of data in given directory. 

     Setup : download files which present in this [directory](https://github.com/DeekshithSN/Lets-Practice/tree/main/ShellScript/Script)
